# Database Security Solution Workshop #

## Workshop Overview ##

This Oracle technical workshop is **FREE** for Oracle System Integrator, ISV, VAR and Platform Partners. 

Learn directly from Oracle Database Product Management how to identify threats and remediate them by leveraging Oracle Database Security features. Oracle Database Security Options are an essential part of the Oracle strategy to protect data and sensitive information in Oracle Databases and offer ways to comply with recent Data Privacy regulations such as EU GDPR. In this technical workshop, participants will learn from presentations and hands-on exercises about the Oracle Database Security features and options. This two-day workshop will cover all topics related to the main rings of data protection: preventive, detective and monitoring. The materials are applicable to various database releases (11gR2, 12c, 18c and 19c). It is also valid wherever the database is deployed on premises or in the cloud.

## Workshop Requirements

DBA experience with Oracle Database 11g, 12c or 18c.
Basic knowledge for Linux commands.
Understand how SSH and VNC work to connect to the servers.

## Agenda

This workshop can be completed in one or two days, depending the labs executed. Usually the structure of the agenda is according to the following layout:

## Day 1

- **Lab 1: Database Security Assessment Tool**
First run of the DBSAT tool to assess your database and define a baseline. From here we'll work on the next labs to improve the *security health* of the database system.

- **Lab 2: Network encryption**
On This lab we will explain and check how the Network Encryption works when connecting to the database.

- **Lab 3: Transparent Data Encryption**
This feature on the database is the basic start in a security strategy to prevent that the sensitive data be at risk. We'll work on the database to create encrypted tablespaces and know the differences between an On Premise installation compared with a Database Cloud Service.

- **Lab 4: Data Redaction**
On this lab we will know how to implement Data redaction which is a functionality only available for Oracle Database. It allow us to secure the database to prevent that sensitive data leave the database unprotected. 

- **Lab 5: Privilege Analysis**
We will know how to run an analysis to detect over privileged users on the Database.

- **Lab 6: Database Vault**
This lab explains how to protect the database from the administrators themselves and prevent misuse or human errors that can disrupt the availability and integrity of the system.

## Day 2

- **Lab 7: Database Audit**
Configuration and explanation about the Unified Auditing on the Database and how this help us to simplify the administration and auditing of the system.

- **Lab 8: Audit Vault**
On this lab we will work on the auditing appliance solution from Oracle to unify the audit information from different systems in a single vault and understand how to create compliance reports using the information gathered. 

- **Lab 9: Data Masking**
Using Enterprise Manager Cloud Control we will create a masked database that can be given to non-productive environment or third party teams with out the sensitive data that is subject to compliance and regulations.

- **Lab 10: Re run DBSAT to compare results**
After all the remediations implemented on the previous labs, we run the DBSAT again to compare the results and understand how the Oracle Database Security options and solutions help the enterprises to comply with regulations and protect sensitive data and ensure a proper configuration based on the industry best practices. 

### Optional for Day 2

### [**Data Safe**](https://fpons.github.io/DataSafe/ "Data Safe Labs") labs
Labs to use and demonstrate the functionalities of the Data Safe solution that we have on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to secure the databases.
