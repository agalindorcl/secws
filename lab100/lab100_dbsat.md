# Lab 1: Database Security Assessment Tool

The Oracle Database Security Assessment Tool (DBSAT) identifies sensitive data, analyzes database configurations, users, their entitlements and security policies to uncover security risks and improve the security posture of Oracle Databases within your organization. You can use DBSAT to implement and enforce security best practices in your organization and accelerate compliance with regulations such as the EU GDPR. 

DBSAT reports on existing sensitive data, the state of user accounts, role and privilege grants, and policies that control the use of various security features in the database. 

DBSAT generates two types of reports: 
- Database Security Risk Assessment report 
- Database Sensitive Data Assessment report 

You can use report findings to: 
- Fix immediate short-term risks 
- Implement a comprehensive security strategy
